              Description: Written by a leading expert in the field, this book
              provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts
              of transport and data networks. This resource examines backbone
              network architectures and functions. The evolution, key
              components, and techniques of telecommunication networks are
              presented, including voice and data transmission, fiber optic
              communication and optical link design. This book explores the
              photonic network architecture and includes chapters on transport
              networks, synchronous optical networks, optical transport
              networks, and dense wavelength division multiplexing.

              Description: Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean,
              it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year,
              countless hours and significant resources are lost because of
              poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted
              software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm
              with this book.

              Description: Thinking with Type is the definitive guide to using
              typography in visual communication, from the printed page to the
              computer screen. This revised edition includes forty-eight pages
              of new content, including the latest information on style sheets
              for print and the web, the use of ornaments and captions, lining
              and non-lining numerals, the use of small caps and enlarged
              capitals, as well as information on captions, font licensing,
              mixing typefaces, and hand lettering. Throughout the book, visual
              examples show how to be inventive within systems of typographic
              form—what the rules are and how to break them. Thinking with Type
              is a type book for everyone: designers, writers, editors,
              students, and anyone else who works with words.
